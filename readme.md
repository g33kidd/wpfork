## WPFork

Currently this is just a fork of WordPress, but I set out for it to be something extremely special.

## Plans

- Rewrite some of the code and restructure the files.
- Use composer for bringing in 3rd party packages with ease.
- Support sass/es6 out of the box.
- Use some laravel components like illuminate or find something similar.
- Use a template language and/or HTML w/ php for templates.
